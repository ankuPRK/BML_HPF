### What's included:

There are four ipython notebook files, which will help reproduce the experiments in the aforementioned paper:

* [**buildVQ_MSD.ipynb**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dawenl/stochastic_PMF/blob/master/code/buildVQ_MSD.ipynb): Build the VQ Codebook for the Million Song Dataset and vector-quantize the MSD and save to disk.

* [**processLastfmTags.ipynb**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dawenl/stochastic_PMF/blob/master/code/processLastfmTags.ipynb): Process the tagging data from Last.fm and build the vocabulary and bag-of-tags representation and save to disk.

* [**tagging_ooc.ipynb**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dawenl/stochastic_PMF/blob/master/code/tagging_ooc.ipynb): After building the VQ-histogram and bag-of-tags, this one will reproduce the results from the data saved on the disk.

* [**tagging_in_memory.ipynb**](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dawenl/stochastic_PMF/blob/master/code/tagging_in_memory.ipynb): If you have enough memory, you can also save the data from **tagging_ooc.ipynb** and directly fit to the PMF with this notebook.

### Dependencies:
* numpy 
* scipy
* scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)
* nltk (for tag stemming)
